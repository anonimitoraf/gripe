#+TITLE: Roadmap

* Must-have
- [-] Implement file-preview (similar to `ivy-calling`) [25%]
  - [X] Moving through matches should auto-preview
  - [ ] Avoid using ivy-posframe (because then, you can't see the matches)
  - [ ] Show the first-line of the matches
    - Probably not possible until ivy-posframe is avoided otherwise, it might undesirably wrap
  - [ ] Highlight the matches in the file preview (sort of like what swiper does)
* Nice-to-have
- [ ] Support https://github.com/borkdude/grasp
